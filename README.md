## Overview of the Project

### Project: QUIZ GAME BASED ON SOME GENERAL KNOWLEDGE

## Objective
The project quiz game is a C++ program that simulates based on General Knowledge. The program defines a struct Question to represent a quiz question, with attributes for the question itself, multiple-choice options, and the correct answer. It also includes functions to display a question and its choices, as well as to check if the user's answer is correct and update the score.In the main function, ten quiz questions related to General knowledge are defined, each with the question, choices, and correct answer. These questions are then stored in an array. The program initializes a score variable and proceeds to present each question to the user in a loop. For each question, the user is prompted to enter their answer, and the program checks if the answer is correct, updating the score accordingly.After all the questions have been answered, the program displays the final score and provides feedback based on the score achieved. If the user has answered all questions correctly, a message is displayed; otherwise, a message for better luck next time is shown.
